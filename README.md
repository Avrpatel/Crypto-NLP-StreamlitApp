## Overall Aim 

The aim of this project is to give investors a holistic view of the performance and potential trajectory of six different crypto currencies. We designed a streamlit app that provides clear insights and easily comprehensible data about both the close price of the currency and the sentiments expressed in news articles about the currecy. The app is user friendly and provides timeline graphs as well as dataframes with the original data should users want to drill down further.

The following currencies and coins will be the focus of the analysis:

*Bitcoin
*Ethereum
*Luna
*Binance
*Cardano
*Solana

The components of the analysis provided in the app are listed below:

*Evan - historical close values and logistic regression model
*Christine - Alphavantage news and intelligence sentiment analysis
*Avi - additional news api and streamlit app design
